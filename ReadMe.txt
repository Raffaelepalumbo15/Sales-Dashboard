Welcome to My Portfolio Project! 
Unfortunately, Power BI does not support public sharing like Tableau. Until I fully replicate this dashboard in Tableau, you'll have to explore it through the offline Power BI file.

However, if you're short on time, you can:
✅ Get a quick preview of my data visualization skills through the screenshots in the folder 
✅ Read the Strategic Business Review, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the data, key insights, and high-level strategic recommendations 

📂 Project Files Overview
📁 Dashboard Screenshots → A collection of key visuals from the Power BI dashboard for a quick preview.

📄 Complete Strategic Business Review.docx →  This is the main document to check! It contains a detailed breakdown 
of the business performance, using the dashboard insights to drive strategic recommendations for sales management.

📦 Data.zip → The synthetic dataset used to build this analysis.

📊 Executive Sales Dashboard.pbip → The Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard. If you have Power BI installed, you can open it and explore the full interactive experience.
